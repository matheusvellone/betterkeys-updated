# BetterKeys-Updated

Better key information for SPT-AKI. Originally by SirTyler, updated by maxloo2.

## Features & Changes

- Colored background for keys and keycards according to map they belongs to. (Marked keys still have their yellow backgrounds, this can be configured with `ChangeMarkedKeysBackground: true`)
- Maps, Extracts, Quests and Loot information in the item descriptions.
- **[Updated]** Auto-update from GitHub repository: which means if the code is updated, you can automatically fetch the latest Key Info DB from GitHub. (Enabled by default, can be configured with `enableAutoUpdate: false`)
- **[Removed]** Key Tier List (I don't think it was actually enabled anyway).

Please refer to the original mod for more/ legacy descriptions: https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/895-better-keys/

## To-do List

- Fix auto-update (it works now but not quite)
- Clean up unused code for Key Tier List
- Display Junk Keys in BLACK (not implemented)

If you find any problems please comment or ping me on SPT discord: @maxloo2

Feel free to make pull requests on GitHub if you find anything outdated/ broken, I will be actively maintaining this repository even if I don't have time to make new updates.

I do not have too much experiences with Unity/ C# modding so any help in that regard will be much appreciated!
